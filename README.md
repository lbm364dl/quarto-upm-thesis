Work in Progress quarto extension for UPM thesis. Trying to follow [UPM thesis LaTeX template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/upm-thesis-template-es/ycptmymgxdzj).

After you have [installed Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/), you can open a terminal and write:

```bash
quarto use template lbm364dl/quarto-upm-thesis
```

It will download this template and make it ready to use.

When you do `quarto render` or [click _Render_ in RStudio](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio.html#rendering), by default Quarto will generate a PDF for you.

You have some customization parameters. Check the config file `_quarto.yml`, you'll figure out what you might want to change.
