# Methods

## Data Sources

We used simulated data representing urban population growth, economic output, and ecological metrics over a 20-year period.

## Model Description

The model integrates economic indicators with ecological constraints. Key equations include:

$$
E_t = E_{t-1} + \alpha \cdot G_t - \beta \cdot U_t
$$

where $E_t$ is the ecological index at time $t$, $G_t$ is economic growth, and $U_t$ represents urbanization pressures.
